What is this mod about?
-----
* __Seamless Integration:__ Merging over 100 fantastic mods into one curated package, ensuring they work together smoothly rather than feeling like separate add-ons.
* __Beyond the Space Age:__ Discover new planets packed with unique resources and gimmicks, integrated into an expanded tech tree that pushes gameplay far beyond vanilla Space Age endgame.
* __Expanded Technologies & Buildings:__ Enjoy a more interconnected progression system—materials from one world fuel research and production on another, unlocking advanced structures and new ways to scale your megabase.
* __Cohesive Gameplay:__ Instead of juggling multiple standalone mods, everything is woven into a single, streamlined experience that rewards exploration, innovation, and the eternal Factorio motto: “The Factory must grow!”
* __Ensured Compatibility__: Long gone are the worries of errors on startup. This project will ensure that each new version won't break your factory nor your mind.
* __Balanced Gameplay__: Addressing odd or overpowered interactions that can arise when multiple mods combine, so no single “winning strategy” overshadows the rest—keeping the challenge and variety alive.
* __Original Additions__: Introducing brand-new items, systems, and content personally created to fill in the gaps and unify all these mods, boosting synergy and expanding your factory’s possibilities.
